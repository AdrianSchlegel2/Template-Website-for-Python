# Template Website for Python

**NOT REAL PYTHON WEBSITE**

 A Website I programmed over the last few days. The website in itself is a template website which you can use for any digital product (probably an application due to the buttons). I myself used Python because that was the first thing that really came to mind, however feel free to use it for any digital product / service and customize it by changing the code in the .colored-section in the CSS.
 
 I mainly coded this website to experiment with Twitters Open Source Frontend-CSS-Framework: Bootstrap, which made the website really beautiful. I also implemented certain advanced CSS functions like the Z-Index, Media Queries, etc.
